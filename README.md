# kustom
My [KLWP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kustom.wallpaper&hl=en)

## Usage
Import .zip or .klwp files to ~/Kustom/wallpapers

Pro version of KLWP is needed to import files.

## Functionality
There might be some functionality that find missing between the example demos/screenshots and what is in the KLWP file. Generally speaking, I use Nova gestures to launch the app drawer and a scrollable dock that has icons hidden most of the time. Hopefully that resolves some potential questions with regards to usability.
