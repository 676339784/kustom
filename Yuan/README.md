## Description
Three screens: Analog clock, music player, weather.

The triangle app launcher is not a Kustom action as I thought it was laggy. Instead I just placed an invisible app drawer over the triangle for all the screens.

There are a couple of invisible "options" for each widget as well, such as opening lyric apps and force updating weather. Make sure to look over them.
