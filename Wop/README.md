# Wop 

## Description
Two screens, one one and one music.

Make sure to change the defaults for apps. I'm personally using things like QuickLyric for lyrics as an example -- make sure to change the button for that to open an app of your choosing if you don't use that.

If you want to change the home wallpaper, just poke around in that section -- I labeled all the Komponents for reference.
