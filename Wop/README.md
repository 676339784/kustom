# Wop 

## Description
Two screens, one one and one music.

Be sure to look for all the on-tap functions I've set. I'm personally using things like QuickLyric for lyrics as an example -- make sure to change the button for that to open an app of your choosing if you don't use that.

My config:
  - Home:
    - Clock opens clock app
    - Date opens calendar app
    - Two lines of weather opens weather app
  - Music:
    - Artist opens opens music app that is playing
    - Song/album plays/pauses music
    - Lyrics opens lyrics app

If you want to change the home wallpaper, just poke around in that section -- I labeled all the Komponents for reference.
